# BLTC
Better Living Through Chemicals

BLTC originally was a collection of Milkdrop Visualiser presets created by a Winamp forum user by the name ```bitcore```.
The original thread can still be found here: http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?s=&threadid=197254

The original website hosting the collections is only available through the wayback machine here: https://web.archive.org/web/20150824194124/http://www.bitcore.org/stuff/

This repo is an atempt to preserve the collection of presets and perhaps expand/update it.
